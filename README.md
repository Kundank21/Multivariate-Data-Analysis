# Multivariate Data Analysis and Classification Techniques
This repository contains work on the application of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on multivariate datasets, with a focus on outlier detection, classification, and distribution comparison.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze multivariate data, develop classifiers, and evaluate model suitability across different methods. Key aspects include computing multivariate quantiles, outlier detection, and comparing distributions using advanced statistical techniques.

Key Features

Multivariate Quantiles and Outlier Detection - Employed statistical techniques and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to compute multivariate quantile contours and detect outliers using Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

Classifier Development - Developed various classifiers for multidimensional data using the following methods:

Data Depth Method ,Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Random Forest


Distribution Comparison - Designed a test based on the Data Depth method to assess whether two distributions originate from the same underlying population.

Datasets Used

Iris Dataset: Used for species distribution analysis and feature comparison.

Heart Disease Dataset: Applied classifiers to predict heart disease presence.

Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset: Evaluated empirical misclassification probabilities for breast cancer diagnosis.

Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Analyzed the structure of the datasets to identify key features, relationships, and potential outliers.

Outlier Detection with PCA - Used PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify outliers in multivariate data.

Classifier Evaluation - Compared model performance across various classifiers by calculating empirical misclassification probabilities.

Distribution Testing - Implemented a statistical test using Data Depth techniques to determine if two datasets come from the same distribution.
