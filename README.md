# Multivariate-Data-Analysis
Conducted supervised and unsupervised learning on multivariate data comparing performance and model suitability

I employed statistical techniques and exploratory data analysis to compare iris species distributions in the Iris dataset. Utilizing multivariate datasets, I computed and described multivariate quantile contours, revealing key features. Additionally, I applied various classifiers (depth-based, SVM-based, K-NN-based, and kernel density function-based) on Heart Disease and Breast Cancer Wisconsin datasets, evaluating their empirical misclassification probabilities. I proposed a methodology for outlier detection and estimation in an infinite-dimensional data space, implementing it on generated data with embedded outliers. Furthermore, I developed an estimator for a regression model in L2[0, 1] space and assessed its performance through simulation studies. Independence testing on multivariate data helped determine the relationship between distributions associated with two samples. Lastly, I estimated regression functions and their derivatives using local polynomial mean and median approaches for a dataset suitable for non-parametric regression models, comparing the performance of the obtained estimators.
